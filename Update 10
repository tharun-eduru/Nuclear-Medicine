\section{Role of nuclear medicine}
\Aseptic loosening, the most common cause of prosthetic Failure, is usually due to an inflammatory reaction to one or More of the prosthetic components and can be accompanied by an intense leukocyte response. Aseptic loosening Generally is managed by a single-stage exchange arthroplasty. Infection develops in up to 2% of primary implants And up to 5% of revision implants. The inflammatory reaction accompanying the infected prosthesis can be similar to That in aseptic loosening, with one important difference. Neutrophils are invariably present in large numbers in Infection, but are generally absent in aseptic loosening. Treatment of the infected joint replacement involves excisional arthroplasty, with weeks to months of antimicrobial therapy, followed by revision arthroplasty. Differentiating aseptic loosening from infection can be Challenging, but is extremely important because the treatment is very different. Clinical signs of infection often are Absent. Elevated circulating leukocytes, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and C-reactive protein are suggestive, but Not diagnostic, of infection. The definitive preoperative Diagnostic procedure of joint aspiration and culture is specific, but sensitivity is variable. Plain radiographs are not Specific and hardware-induced artefacts limit, to some degree, CT and magnetic resonance imaging. Radionuclide imaging is extremely useful in the evaluation of painful joint replacements, especially when infections suspected. The most widely and often the initial radionuclide test performed is bone scintigraphy. Although Sensitive, bone scintigraphy is not specific and with an accuracy of 70% is most useful as a screening test. Performing the test as a three-phase study does not improve Accuracy. 67Ga, with an accuracy between 60% and 80%, Offers only a modest improvement over bone scintigraphy Alone, and has fallen into disuse. The best available imaging test for diagnosing prosthetic Joint infection at the present time is WBC/marrow imaging With an accuracy of approximately 90%. All of the studies Published over the past 30 years confirm that the test is Highly specific. In most of the investigations the test has Proved to be sensitive as well. AS already noted, there are significant disadvantages to The WBC/marrow procedure and investigators continue to Search for suitable alternatives. The sensitivity and specificity of 99mTc-besilesomab for joint replacement infection Range from 91% and75%, respectively. By performing bone imaging or semi-quantitative analysis, Sensitivity ranged from 100%; specificity ranged from 100%. The sensitivity and specificity of 99mTc-Sulesomab range from 93% and 86%,Respectively. Dual time point imaging, time activity Curve analysis, and complementary marrow imaging may Improve accuracy. Although these agents eliminate the Drawbacks of in vitro leukocyte labelling, an additional Study, either bone or marrow, imaging still needs to be Performed. Furthermore, because of the immunogenicity Concerns associated with besilesomab, patients should not Undergo repeat studies with this agent. Consequently, Radiolabeled anti-granulocyte antibodies have not gained Wide acceptance in the diagnostic work-up of the painful Joint replacement.
